# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

As a self taught mobile developer, I started creating native projects but am now 
exploring cross platform development with Xamarin. I have the ability to learn 
new tools quickly. When I am not making apps, I am trying to learn new programming 
techniques.
