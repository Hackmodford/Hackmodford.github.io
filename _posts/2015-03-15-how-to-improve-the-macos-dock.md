Screen space on a laptop comes at a high premium. On macOS one of the most important interface elements is the Dock. Unfortunately itâ€™s in the way more times than not. If youâ€™re like me, you might have tried hiding the dock but eventually switch back because of how long it takes for the dock to re-appear when the mouse is at the edge of the screen.

I believe I have found a solution for this problem. Try these two commands in terminal:

```
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.4
killall Dock
```

These commands will disable the delay but also leave the pleasantly smooth animation intact.
We care about these things because weâ€™re macOS users. ðŸ˜‰

If you decide this tweak isnâ€™t for you, you can enter this into the terminal

```
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier
killall Dock
```

Enjoy!
