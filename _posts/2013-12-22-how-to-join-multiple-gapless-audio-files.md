Recently I needed to be able to join multiple mp3 files together to create one giant file. The goal was to create an iTunes audiobook (.m4b) of a audio drama. Typically I would use [AudioBook Builder](https://www.splasm.com/audiobookbuilder/) to accomplish this. (Windows Alternative: [Chapter and Verse](http://lodensoftware.com/chapter-and-verse/))

The problem is if the files are formatted as mp3/m4a when you try to join the files you will hear small gaps between each track. This is REALLY BAD for audio drama. The one solution I came up with was to rip the CDs from iTunes but use the ‚Äújoin track‚Äù feature to create 1 giant file per disc.

This works great if you have the CDs, but what if you only have the compressed audio files?

Here is the solution: First use a program like [XLD](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23430/x-lossless-decoder) to batch convert the files to WAV or AIFF. Then use those files in [AudioBook Builder](https://www.splasm.com/audiobookbuilder/) to create your compiled file. When it is done there will be no gaps. üôÇ

Alternatively, instead of using the ‚Äújoin track‚Äù feature in iTunes I would suggest ripping each track as a WAV or AIFF file then use [AudioBook Builder](https://www.splasm.com/audiobookbuilder/).
