Okay, I know mario is fun even though itâ€™s like 20 years old now. But you have to admit, once youâ€™ve played the old games enough you practically have the levels memorized. At least the first few.

My brother in law came up with this awesome idea. Basically using an emulator you flip the screen horizontally. You also have to flip the left and right buttons around on your keyboard/controller.

The result should look like this.

{% capture carousel_images %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include elements/carousel.html %}

Strange but familiar right?

Iâ€™m on a mac and therefore use an emulator nestopia. Iâ€™m not sure if the other windows emulators will have a setting that can achieve this effect, but itâ€™s worth looking into.
Hereâ€™s some more screenshots to gawk at ðŸ˜‰
